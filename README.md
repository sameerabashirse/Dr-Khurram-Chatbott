# Dr. Khurram Healthcare WhatsApp AI Appointment Chatbot

Production-oriented Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Vanilla JS, and Meta WhatsApp Cloud API appointment system for Dr. Khurram.

The system includes:

- Public website with appointment booking, lookup, rescheduling, cancellation, token card, privacy, emergency guidance, and WhatsApp entry point.
- Secure staff panel with first Super Admin setup, login, appointments, manual entry, WhatsApp conversations, staff takeover, settings, users, and audit logs.
- MongoDB schemas for staff, patients, appointments, consent, opt-out, conversations, WhatsApp messages, delivery statuses, settings, blocked dates/slots, reminders, notifications, audit logs, and refresh sessions.
- Official Meta WhatsApp Cloud API webhook verification, signature verification, message deduplication, delivery status logging, and sender services.
- OpenAI-powered intent/language classification with deterministic fallback logic.
- Clinic schedule enforcement: Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Saturday/Sunday closed, no past or expired slots.

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start MongoDB locally or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d mongo
```

4. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Required Environment Variables

Set all production values before deployment:

```text
MONGODB_URI
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
COOKIE_SECRET
FRONTEND_URL
CORS_ORIGINS
OPENAI_API_KEY
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN
META_APP_SECRET
WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_APPOINTMENT_CONFIRMATION
WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_APPOINTMENT_REMINDER
WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_RESCHEDULE_CONFIRMATION
WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_CANCELLATION_CONFIRMATION
```

Never place these values in `index.html`, `style.css`, or `script.js`.

## Staff Setup

There is no public staff registration and no hardcoded staff account.

1. Open the Staff Panel.
2. If no staff users exist, complete First Super Admin Setup.
3. Sign in with that Super Admin account.
4. Create additional staff users from the Users tab.

Password rules require at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol.

## Meta WhatsApp Cloud API Configuration

1. Create or use a Meta app with WhatsApp product enabled.
2. Add the clinic WhatsApp Business phone number.
3. Copy the phone number ID, business account ID, access token, and app secret into `.env`.
4. Set a strong `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`.
5. Configure webhook callback URL:

```text
https://your-domain.com/api/whatsapp/webhook
```

6. Subscribe to WhatsApp message and message status webhook fields.
7. Create and approve utility templates for confirmation, reminders, reschedule confirmation, and cancellation confirmation.
8. Put approved template names into the matching environment variables.

The backend verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256`, deduplicates incoming Meta message IDs, logs delivery/read/failed statuses, and sends free-form text only inside active conversations. Reminder jobs use template messages.

## OpenAI Configuration

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and optionally `OPENAI_MODEL`. If OpenAI is not configured, the system still uses deterministic intent and language fallback handling for core appointment flows.

The assistant is constrained to appointment management, clinic information, safe emergency guidance, and staff escalation. It does not diagnose, prescribe, or replace a doctor.

## Owner Appointment Email Alerts

New confirmed appointments can queue one durable owner notification after the appointment and outbox record commit in the same MongoDB transaction. The worker sends through SMTP, uses an expiring lock to recover interrupted work, and retries temporary failures after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 1 hour. Email failure never changes the appointment.

The feature is disabled by default. Configure these values privately in the hosting environment:

```text
EMAIL_APPOINTMENT_ALERT_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_APPOINTMENT_ALERT_TO
EMAIL_FROM_NAME
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT
SMTP_SECURE
SMTP_USER
SMTP_PASSWORD
ADMIN_PANEL_URL
```

Do not commit real addresses or SMTP credentials. The MongoDB deployment must support transactions; the included Docker Compose MongoDB service runs as a single-node replica set for local development.

## Appointment Rules

- Open Monday-Friday only.
- Closed Saturday and Sunday.
- Slots before 09:00 and after 16:00 are rejected.
- Past dates and expired time slots are rejected.
- Active appointments cannot share the same date/time.
- A patient cannot hold duplicate active appointments on the same date.
- Lookup requires appointment ID and phone number.
- Cancellation preserves records and releases slots.
- Rescheduling saves previous date/time history.

## Deployment

Use a production MongoDB deployment, HTTPS, a stable public domain, and environment variables managed by the hosting provider.

```bash
npm install --omit=dev --no-audit --no-fund
npm start
```

Health endpoints:

```text
GET /api/health
GET /api/health/ready
```

Production checklist:

- Replace all `.env.example` values.
- Use HTTPS only.
- Set exact `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- Ensure MongoDB indexes are created.
- Configure approved WhatsApp templates.
- Verify webhook challenge and signature validation.
- Test booking, lookup, reschedule, cancellation, reminders, staff takeover, and logout.
- Confirm doctor specialty, qualifications, experience, biography, and address before publishing those details.
- Review audit logs after sensitive staff actions.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Current tests cover clinic slot validation for weekdays, weekends, out-of-hours slots, and past slots.
